    # The quoting on this sed command is a bit complex.  Single-quoted strings
    # don't allow *any* escape mechanism, so they cannot contain a single
    # quote.  The string sed gets (as argv[1]) is:  s/\(['\]\)/\\\1/g
    #
    # Inside a character class, \ and ' are not special, so the ['\] character
    # class is balanced and contains two characters.
